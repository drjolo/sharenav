         Typing a key will narrow down the favorites / waypoints list.
         With the "#"-key you can toggle to sort the waypoints / favorites by name or distance.

       *** GPS and other location producers ***
       - JSR-179: Some devices (e.g. Nokia E71 and E90) did not show the speed / rotate the map to the driving direction.

       - Show name of closest routable way in status bar: If the closest routable way is not too far away
         when the map is centered to GPS show its label instead of any way's label (this avoids that
         you see e.g. names of rivers or city borders when the GPS signal is not exact enough)
       - Stop showing closest way name in status bar if you are too far away       
       - Added "Name Check" feature to Overview/Filter Map,
         this can be used to show only unnamed/named or ways/areas/POIs containing a certain string in the map

       - Display the name of the street the route instruction leads into
       - Highlighting the route solution path (the route solution is drawn on top if the map is synched with
         the GPS receiver but when panning manually it will respect the layer information),
         the minimum width of the route solution path can be specified in Setup/Routing Options 
       - Improved off-route detection
       - Routing instructions for entering and exiting motorways, for roundabouts, tunnels,
         for bearing if two alternative ways lead straight on and for following the street until further notice,
         when there's no instruction for at least 1200 meters
       - Browse the route instructions with up/down keys (can be deactivated in Setup)
       - Skip half turn instructions if the street name stays the same and straight-ons
       - Improved recalculation detection: you can now set the target, calculate the route
         then Start Gps. When there's a new position from the GPS the route recalculation will
         be automatically performed
       - Some wrong direction arrows are fixed
       - See also next section for creating midlets with bicycle routing
       *** Midlet creation with Osm2GpsMid ***
       - Osm2GpsMid is now compiled to be compatible with Java 1.5 Runtime (for example on older Mac OSX)
       - RouteAccessRestrictions are now specified in the style-file instead of hardcoded into Osm2GpsMid
         and can be specified for separate vehicles
       - Each way can contain multiple routing entries (e.g. one for motorcar and one for bicycle)
       - Only the routing entries and RouteAccessRestrictions for the useRouting-parameter in the properties files
         are packed by Osm2GpsMid into the midlet, specify either "useRouting=motorcar" or "useRouting=bicycle"
         in you properties file
       - The Osm2GpsMid Wizard writes out the selected regions and chosen parameters
         on exit to a file called "last.properties" in the current directory even when canceled.
         This is a new way to easily get the necessary region parameters.
       - Use HTTP compression for downloading map data if the server supports it
       *** Others ***
       - Speed limit alert - configurable in Setup / Sounds & Alerts (thx jkpj)
       - Tacho and Trip screen (opened by the 7 key or menu entry) which show
         information such as speed, altitude, distance and time traveled,
         course, heading and distance to destination, ...

         for the calculation class)  
       - More documentation in the source code (thx black_ivory and pos_ei_don_)

         in the map regardless of zoom level for an overview.
         This can be useful to get a quick overview of a certain POI/Area/Way type in the area, i.e. hotels or railways.
         You can optionally choose to show POI/Area/Way types that are
         not selected in the Overview list normal or filter them out from display.

       - Exporting and importing waypoints always use UTF-8 now (thx bilboq)
       - Existing waypoints.gpx files are now correctly overwritten (thx bilboq)
       - "Export all" command for GPX tracklogs

       - show midlet version and bundling date in splash screen
       *** Osm2GpsMid Usability ***
       - A graphical Osm2GpsMid Wizard starts if no command line parameters are given
       - allow to specify bounds on command line if no properties file is specified:
         java -Xmx1024M -jar Osm2GpsMid-0.4.x.jar --bounds=23.48,34.78,26.37,35.7 osmxapi
