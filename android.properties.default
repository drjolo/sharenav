# Copy this file (android.properties.default) to android.propertise and edit paths to be correct
# Then use ant -propertyfile android.properties to build GpsMid for android

# To bundle a map within the .apk, use something like
#   tools/bundlemap.sh -a assets dist/GpsMid*.ap_ (requires bash and some common unix-like-OS tools)
# (assets dir must have a map created by Osm2GpsMid and e.g. tools/unbundlemap.sh)

#The android.home property should point to the directory
#containing the Android SDK.
#Generally it's better to set this in J2MEPolish (at install)
#android.home=/path/to/android-sdk/set/in/build.properties

#Building for android requires a newer J2ME-Polish than
#2.1.4, set path to it here. Moslty obsolete now when 2.2.1 supports android
#polish.home=/set/path/to/J2ME-Polish-2.2.1-or-nightly/in/android.properties
