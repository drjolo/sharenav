ShareNav 0.8.5
    - Android: to be able to install ShareNav on SD card, a modified
      version of J2MEPolish (or hopefully a later version) needs to be used to compile
      ShareNav. A patch is available at https://sourceforge.net/support/tracker.php?aid=3582428
    - Android: j2mepolish-diffs/diff.telephony-121102-1412 applied to j2mepolish-src
      will stop ShareNav from needing access to phone info, so this needs to be applied
      to build ShareNav which doesn't need phone permission.
      For unmodified J2MEPolish source which accesses phone IMEI etc,
      add READ_PHONE_STATE to android.permissions in build.xml.

ShareNav 0.8.4
    - new target Generic/Java
      Technically, the target builds ShareNav with microemulator bundled, so user
      doesn't need to separately install microemulator to use ShareNav.

ShareNav 0.8.3
    *** Start of ShareNav code base ***
    - Start development of ShareNav, based on the source code from GpsMid release 0.8.2.
